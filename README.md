# Analysis and modelling of bridge conditions in Texas

This document examines data provided by National Bridge Inspection maintained by the Federal Highways Agency (FHWA), part of the US Department of Transportation. It consists of a table that contains various metrics concerning the condition of all existing bridges in the state of Texas.

I carry out an exploratory analysis of the data and then perform linear regression to determine whether the current condition of the bridges can be determined based on serval different attributes of the bridges. In particular, I use the attibutes AverageDaily, Trucks_percent, Material, Design and the derived attribute Age as independent variables which will predict the current condition of the bridge.
